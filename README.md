# Physics 188 - Bayesian Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Physical Sciences

A repo for holding all my course resources from Physics 188: Bayesian Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Physical Sciences. Some data necessary for running the notebooks is emitted due to large file sizes. These are not official solutions to the course material, this repo is merely just a place to quickly reference my analyses tools.
